# Password Generato App

![Design preview for the Password Generator App](./design/Desktop%20Design.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end Project.

**To do this Project, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The Project

This project is to build out this Password Generator App and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Choose Password length and options i.e numbers/symbols/uppercase/lowercase.
- Generate Random Password and use both copy and refresh password functionality through clickable buttons.
- Receive a confirmation when copied.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in PNG static format. Using PNGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
